# README

This is my first rails project!
Instructions for starting a project in Ruby on Rails:

Open a terminal or command prompt. Go to the directory where you want to link the project. Enter command:

git clone git@github.com:Sunmarli/Ruby-test.git

cd Ruby-test

bundle install

rails db:create

rails db:migrate

rails s

Tests are running by entering:

rails test 


Enjoy :)
